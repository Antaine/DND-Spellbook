Did research online looking for websites that do something that is similar to what our app idea is.
Went to see what we can learn from these and what we can do different.
Worked on designing the logo for the app

Finished designing logo for app.
Create a second logo for app, this a gif image where the logo changes the colour red to maroon. 
Upon looking at this I could see that it was a bit flashy and distracting. 
At the moment Antaine and I decided to use the orginal image created as the logo for the time being
