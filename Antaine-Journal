        - Have a basic CRUD App connecting to the database.
        - Connected Create Character to the database uploading data but the values are null. I believe this is because I removed formGroup from
        The HTML Component because it was going errors but the sample I created was based off sending the data as an object collected from the form group
        and that's why the values are empty upon reaching the database.
